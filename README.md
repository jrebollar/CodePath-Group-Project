## Overview
### Description
An app that displays the locations of nearby toilets/restrooms through the use of GPS.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Health
- **Mobile:** App is primarily designed for mobile devices
- **Story:** Collect submitted information from users and display them in a way easy to parse through.
- **Market:** Individuals who need to locate a restroom (in its current state, must be on CPP campus)
- **Habit:** The app would be used any time you need to find/rate a restroom.
- **Scope:** We would start by using our own database to store the restroom locations/ratings. The app could potentially be implemented into Google maps.
